Alexa APIs for Python

|Docs| |License|

The **Alexa APIs for Python** consists of python classes that represent the 
request and response JSON of Alexa services. These models act as a core 
dependency for the `Alexa Skills Kit Python SDK <https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-python>`__.

These model classes are auto-generated using the `JSON schemas <https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html>`__
in the developer documentation.
